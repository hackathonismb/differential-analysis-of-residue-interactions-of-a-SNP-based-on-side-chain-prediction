# Local Force Field Adjustment of Structure Mutations in iCn3d

### Introduction

The program iCn3D is a web application to vizualize and analyze structural data. One feature is to introduct mutations to the protein to compare the original structure and mutant variant. Currently, the structure is processed using scap, a program to predict side-chain conformations, and render the results. This project seeks to further estimate the new structural conformation using MD simulation. 

### Current Tasks

1. Choose a molecular simulation program to implement a RESTful API for iCn3D to interace with.
2. Design a protocol for MD simulation and PDB file preprocessing.
3. Implement and validate the protocol and API calls.
4. Integrate into iCn3D.
