# Local Force Field Adjustment and Differential Analysis of Structure Mutations in iCn3d

### Introduction

iCn3D is a web application to vizualize and analyze structural data. One feature is to introduct mutations to the protein to compare the original structure and mutant variant. Currently, the structure is processed using scap, a program to predict side-chain conformations, and render the results. However, no additional structural prediction for the mutation is done, such as how the backbone for the residue might change. 

### What this project aims to do

This project seeks to offer additional improvements to the mutation structure estimation by predicting the conformational changes for the backbone and through MD simulations. The results are to be benchmarked by comparing the computationally predicted structures to experimentally derived structures. To aid in differential analysis, information on annotated functional regions of proteins and their distance to a mutation will also be provided as a new feature.
