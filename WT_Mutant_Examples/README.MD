# Wildtype and Mutant Examples

This folder contains a couple example PDB files, each with a mutation from the S2648 dataset. The files are given with the same naming as in iCn3D output PDB files and PDB files from a mutation analysis. The fasta files were generate using the pdb_to_fasta.py script.
